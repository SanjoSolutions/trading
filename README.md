# Trading

I have created a Google Sheets Apps Script app for tracking "virtual" trades. Via the form in the sidebar, trades can be made (buying or selling). The trades sheet shows all trades that have been made. The inventory sheet shows the current inventory. The balance sheet shows how much money has been made with buying and selling.

## How to install

1. Open the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iHS1Rn1EDHJKHHshx1qzJOUNGcj5RDHgkZmoopqTbfk/edit?usp=sharing).
2. Make a copy of the spreadsheet via File -> Make a copy. Confirm making a copy by pressing the button "Make a copy".
3. Authorization of the apps script: After a while, the menu item "Trading" appears in the menu bar. Click the menu item "Trading" and select the option "Trade". Then it prompts with an "Authorization Required" dialog. Click the button "Continue". Then choose your account. Then click "Advanced". Then click "Go to Trading (unsafe)". Then click the button "Allow".

## How to make trades

Click the menu item "Trading" and select the option "Trade". On the right, a sidebar should appear. Here you can select the action (buy or sell), the symbol of the stock and the amount.

## How to modify or extend the script

The functionality has been programmed via Apps Script. The code is open source and can be checked out under Extensions -> Apps Script.
